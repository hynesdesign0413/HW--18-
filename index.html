                <h2> Empathy</h1>
                <p> Everything starts with the user and keeping them at the front of the design
                    process is critical. I want to understand their immediate frustrations
                    and limitations to create a more memorable experience. Seeing the issues from
                    their point of view is the best place to start when designing a product.

                <h2> Hierarchy </h1>
                <p> Using Visual Hierarchy to create a memomrable experience for
                    the user is a top skill. I accomplish this by having key elements organzied so users easily
                    take in all the information and can navigate the product. Having good Visual Hierarchy
                    can create a memorable experience, creating a repeated user.

                <h2> Research</h1>
                <p> In order to develop prodcuts that satisfy user needs you first need to know
                    who your user is, what frustrations they have, and what their needs are. I
                    gather all of this information being conducting interviews, surveys, and other
                    web-based research methods.
